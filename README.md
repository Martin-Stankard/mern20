# mern20
kicking the mern tires late 2020

1. cd into /server, npm start
2. cd into /client, npm start
3. at localhost:3000, make a post and verify it in db
4. TODO, swap in local docker db and do something cool with a volume (named or bindpoint....)
    - volume persists
    - volume can be inspected when db is offline(?)
    - volume can be reset reasonably easily
