kicking the mern tires 2020

1. cd into /server, npm start
2. cd into /client, npm start
3. localhost:3000

# TODO docker-compose up
1. debug date behavior, mongoose model  'default: new Date()',
2. debug/introduce redraw of selected img file with form.clear(),
3. update post redraw is intermittent...can I rule out browser as cause.
    - dream solution is realtime udate, submit on lose focus of field. Desirable?
